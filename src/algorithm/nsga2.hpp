    /**
    * Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), used for multi-objective optimization.
    * This algorithm doesn't work for single-objective problems.
    * 
    * The aim of the algorithm is to find a set of solutions which are well spread out
    * along the entire pareto-front in the objective-space.
    * 
    * The algorithm uses a non-dominated sorting method to sort the candidates of the population
    * into distinct pareto fronts, and then selects the candidates of the best fronts for the
    * population of the next generation.
    * Candidates that belong to the same front are ranked according to their crowding distances,
    * which are their distances from the neigbouring solutions in the objective space.
    * 
    * The algorithm uses a selection operator that selects solutions for the crossovers
    * based on these same criteria (their pareto ranks and crowding distances).
    * 
    * The algorithm assumes fitness maximization, and has no parameters.
    *
