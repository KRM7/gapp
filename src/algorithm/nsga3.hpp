    * NSGA-III algorithm, used for multi- and many-objective optimization.
    * This algorithm doesn't work for single-objective problems.
    * 
    * The aim of the algorithm is to find a set of solutions which are well spread out
    * along the entire pareto-front in the objective-space.
    * 
    * The algorithm uses a non-dominated sorting method to sort the solutions into a
    * set of distinct pareto fronts, and then selects the candidates of the best fronts
    * for the population of the next generation.
    * Candidates that belong to the same front are ranked using a set of reference
    * directions in the objective space. The candidate solutions closest to a reference
    * directions which has less candidates associated with it, and candidates closer to
    * reference directions are considered better.
    * 
    * The algorithm uses a selection operator that selects candidates for the crossovers
    * based on these same criteria (their pareto ranks and their distances from the reference directions).
    * 
    * The reference directions are generated at the start of the run, and don't change throughout it.
    * The method used for generating the reference directions can be specified in the constructor.
    * 
    * The algorithm assumes fitness maximization, and it has no parameters.
