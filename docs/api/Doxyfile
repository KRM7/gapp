# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify a logo or an icon that is included

# pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy
# the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path

# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = 

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES, doxygen will include brief member

# If the SEPARATE_MEMBER_PAGES tag is set to YES then doxygen will produce a new

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines (in the resulting output). You can put ^^ in the value part of an
# alias to insert a newline as if a physical newline was in the original file.
# When you need a literal { or } or , in the value part of an alias you have to
# escape them by means of a backslash (\), this can lead to conflicts with the

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
